# **Dark Matter Mapping via Weak Lensing and Deep Learning**  

## **Overview**  
This project aims to reconstruct dark matter mass maps from weak gravitational lensing data using deep learning techniques. By leveraging data from large-scale sky surveys (e.g., DES Y6), I will develop machine learning models to improve upon traditional mass-mapping methods, addressing challenges such as noise, missing data, and systematic biases.  

## **Objectives**  
- **Preprocess Weak Lensing Data**: Extract galaxy shear measurements, apply coordinate transformations, and handle survey masks using inpainting techniques.  
- **Develop Deep Learning-Based Mass Mapping**: Implement CNNs, Vision Transformers, or Bayesian neural networks to reconstruct convergence maps.  
- **Improve Uncertainty Quantification**: Integrate Bayesian deep learning to estimate confidence intervals on mass reconstructions.  
- **Enhance Data Completeness**: Apply generative models (e.g., diffusion models, GANs) to inpaint missing regions in weak lensing surveys.  
- **Cross-Survey Generalization**: Test model robustness across multiple surveys (e.g., DES, HSC, KiDS, LSST).  

## **Expected Impact**  
This research will contribute to the development of more accurate and data-driven methods for mapping the dark matter distribution in the universe. By refining machine learning-based approaches for weak lensing analysis, this project will help improve constraints on cosmological parameters and our understanding of large-scale structure formation.
